The `amiet_tools` (AmT) Python package provides a reference implementation of
Amiet's [JSV 41, 1975] model for turbulence-aerofoil interaction noise with
extensions. These functions allow the calculation of the surface pressure jump
developed over the aerofoil surface (i.e. the acoustic source distribution) in
response to incoming turbulence, and of the acoustic field radiated by the
interaction. Incoming turbulence can be a single sinusoidal gust, or a sum of
incoherent gusts with amplitudes given by a prescribed energy spectrum.

Other capabilities include the modeling of convection and
refraction effects on sound propagation to model acoustic measurements
performed in a closed- or open-jet wind tunnel.

These codes were originally written by Fabio Casagrande Hirono between 2014 and
2018, while studying for a PhD degree in Acoustical Engineering at the Institute
of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR), University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.

## Dependencies:
* numpy: array processing for numbers, strings, records, and objects;
* scipy: scientific library.


All dependencies are already included in the Anaconda Python Distribution, a
free and open source distribution of Python. Anaconda 4.8.2 (with Python 3.7)
was used to develop and test AmT, and is recommended for using AmT.

## How to install:
1. First make sure that you have the package [*setuptools*](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) installed.
2. Install through pip, by using the following command:
    ``` pip install git+https://github.com/fchirono/amiet_tools ```

## How to uninstall:
1. Uninstall with pip, by using the following command:
    ``` pip uninstall amiet_tools ```

## Python Tutorials
Here are some recommended tutorials on Python programming for scientists and engineers. All are of excellent quality, and discuss not only the Python language itself but also good programming practices in general:
